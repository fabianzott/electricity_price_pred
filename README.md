# electricty_price_pred

## Introduction

`electricty_price_pred` is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the electricity spot prices in Germany for the next day (Day-Ahead Price, 15-min intervals) utilizing an array of data sources, including net electricity generation figures from Germany, commodity prices, weather conditions, economic indicators, and information pertaining to events like public holidays.

Key data sources for this project encompass the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer-Institut f√ºr Solare Energiesysteme ISE), the Federal Statistical Office of Germany (Statistisches Bundesamt), and publicly available weather data.

The project's fundamental approach involves retrieving data stored on Google BigQuery. This data then undergoes a series of processing steps, including preprocessing, scaling, and the application of various machine learning models for training. The ultimate goal is to forecast future electricity prices in Germany with a model that can integrate real-time data updates to improve prediction accuracy.
